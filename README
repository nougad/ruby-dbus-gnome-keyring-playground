Playground for some ruby - dbus - gnome-keyring - stuff

Sorry for bad coding style - it's only some personal playground.

Feel free to contact me.


IMPORTANT:
Required to apply introspection.path to gnome-keyring introspection files usually located at /usr/share/gnome-keyring/introspect/

If it's necessary to include rubygems manually run ruby with "-r rubygems"

Encrypted transfer of secret (encrypted.rb) does not work. Tried different Diffie Hellman implementations (dh.rb, dh-openssl.rb, dhkeyexchange gem) and different AES implementations (openssl and ruby-aes gem) but without any success

DEPENDENCIES:
* ruby-dbus gem (tested with 0.6)
